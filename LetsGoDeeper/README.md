# Let's Go Deeper Mod

This mod forces players to enter through the main entrance and exit through fire exits by giving doors a consciousness.

Credits go to the developer of the [We Need To Go Deeper](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Sirus/We_Need_To_Go_Deeper/) Mod, since that's where the idea is coming from!<br>
You want to know the difference between those mods?<br>
Well, in functionality, none, except for the fact that this mod also supports modded moons!

Now also with config options and requirements for leaving through the main entrance!
